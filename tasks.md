# Quick Capture

Add tasks here and they'll sync to your project files when you save.

**Format:** `- [ ] Task name | due date | project`

- Each line starts with `- [ ]` (that's dash, space, open bracket, space, close bracket)
- Then your task name
- Then `|` and a due date like `2026-02-15` (optional)
- Then `|` and a project name like `newsletter` (optional — AI will auto-detect if you skip this)

## Examples (Reference - Do Not Delete)
- [ ] Review project roadmap | 2026-02-10 | sample-project
- [ ] Plan sprint goals | 2026-02-15 | sample-project
